AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

Application allows users to create and save notes, view previously saved notes and delete previously saved notes.
Application can be used by first running 'npm install' followed by running the application. Running 'node server.js' should show the App listening on PORT: 3000.
Pulling up localhost: 3000 in your internet browser should show the 'note taker' app.
